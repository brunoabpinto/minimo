        <p>
            Minimo is a minimal PHP framework focused on fast iteration: simple controller routing and file-based
            rendering for Blade and Markdown views.
        </p>
        <p>
            The stack currently supports convention-based controllers, Blade templates, and Markdown pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project stays intentionally lightweight so behavior is easy to read directly from the core files.
        </p>
