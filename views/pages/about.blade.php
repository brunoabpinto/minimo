        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            Minimo is a minimal PHP framework focused on fast iteration: simple controller routing, a plugin-driven
            rendering pipeline, and file-based views.
        </p>
        <p>
            The stack currently supports Blade views, Markdown pages, and route-based Vue views through plugins.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is intentionally lightweight so features can be added as plugins instead of framework core.
